Hello!

Its looking rough in here. no worries it may be fixed before long.
They say nothing is more perminant than a tempoary fix that works. :)

Supposed to run on a CAN M4 feather or something like that.
Take a look at code.py most of the stuff is there.

Anything else. Well you know....


So when you want to do development

screen /dev/tty.usbmodem101 115200
The device driver (tty.usbmodem101) may be named differently on your computer.
